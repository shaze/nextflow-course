##Set up

Clone the repo
- `git clone shaze/nextflow-course`

##Exercise 0

Read and run the `show.nf` script
- `nextflow run show.nf`

Read and run the `cleandups.nf` script

Fix the obvious bug -- we will fix the deeper semantic issue later

You should commit your fix into git
- `git commit -a -m "fixed the problem"`

## Exercise 1

If you need some intro to Groovy, checkout the groovy branch
- `git checkout groovy`

Read the `groovy.nf` and run. Make sure you understand.

Otherwise or then move to Exercise 2

## Exercise 2

Checkout the `phase` branch

- `git checkout phase`

In this exercise we fix the semantic problem from Exercise 0 to show that even if we have multiple input
files we get the corrrect result
